Exercise 1: Implementing the Singleton Pattern

Scenario: 

You need to ensure that a logging utility class in your application has only one instance throughout the application lifecycle to ensure consistent logging.

Steps:
1.	Create a New Java Project:
    Create a new Java project named SingletonPatternExample.
2.	Define a Singleton Class:
    Create a class named Logger that has a private static instance of itself.
    Ensure the constructor of Logger is private.
  	Provide a public static method to get the instance of the Logger class.
4.	Implement the Singleton Pattern:
    Write code to ensure that the Logger class follows the Singleton design pattern.
6.	Test the Singleton Implementation:
    Create a test class to verify that only one instance of Logger is created and used across the application.
